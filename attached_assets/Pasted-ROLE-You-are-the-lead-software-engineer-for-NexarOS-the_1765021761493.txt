ROLE:
You are the lead software engineer for NexarOS, the operating UI for the Nexar handheld gaming console (brand owned by Sabre Collective).
Your job is to build the entire software stack using Electron + React + Node.js with a dark/red futuristic theme inspired by Xbox/PlayStation UI.

🎮 PROJECT GOALS

Build a complete OS-like launcher called NexarOS with the following core features:

1. Home Screen

Carousel or tile menu

"Continue Playing" section

Quick links: Nexar Games Store, Library, Settings

Animated transitions

Controller-friendly UI (keyboard navigation first; later expanded)

2. Game Library

Reads local directory (C:/NexarGames/)

Lists installed games with cover art

“Play”, “Delete”, “Manage” options

Detects Steam installation automatically

If found, reads Steam library folders

Adds Steam games to library (no deep integration required)

Ability to sort/filter

3. Nexar Games Store

Storefront UI

Pulls from a simple REST API (also built here)

Game cards

Individual game pages

"Install" button → begins download from API

Shows progress, installs to /NexarGames/<title>

4. OTA Update System

Checks a JSON manifest hosted on Replit

If new version exists, prompts user

Handles download + replacing app files (the updater can be simple and handled at app level)

5. Settings Menu

Theme (Dark/Red only now)

Performance profiles (UI only for now)

Network

Account

Storage usage viewer

System info

6. Steam Installer Shortcut

Detect Steam automatically if installed

If not installed, show a “Install Steam” button

Opens official Steam download page (no bundling Steam itself)

🎨 THEME REQUIREMENTS (IMPORTANT)

Use the Nexar color palette consistently:

Primary Background: #000000 or #111111

Secondary Panels: #1A1A1A

Accent Red: #d00024 (or closest neon red)

Text Primary: #EAEAEA

Text Secondary: #A3A3A3

Glow effects: red shadows/glows on hover/focus

Futuristic UI feel (PS5/Xbox hybrid)

🗂 TECH STACK & GUIDELINES
Frontend

React + Vite

TailwindCSS (strongly preferred)

Framer Motion for animations

Backend (Store + APIs)

Node.js + Express

Simple JSON storage

Endpoints:

/games → list all games

/games/:id → single game

/games/:id/download → provide download file

/updates/latest → OTA manifest

Electron

Build desktop app

Launch React UI

Preload script for interacting with filesystem

Secure IPC

Create an installer (Squirrel or NSIS)

Game Installer Logic

Downloads ZIP archive

Extracts to C:/NexarGames/<game>

Updates local JSON database

Adds to Library automatically

Library Scanner

Recursively scan C:/NexarGames/

For Steam detection:

Check registry (optional)

Check default paths:

C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/

C:/Program Files/Steam/

Read Steam library folders via libraryfolders.vdf

📦 OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Whenever writing code, the AI must provide:

File-by-file output with file paths

Full code for each file

No placeholders unless absolutely necessary

Working build scripts

Clear instructions to run

npm install

npm run dev for frontend

npm run electron for desktop

The agent should always generate production-ready code with comments and consistent styling.

🔧 FOLDER STRUCTURE (AI MUST CREATE THIS)
/nexaros

    utils.js

🧠 WHAT THE AGENT MUST DO

Write code for every part listed

Auto-generate boilerplate

Style everything using the Nexar theme

Ensure frontend compiles

Ensure backend runs

Ensure Electron can load frontend

Add comments, explanations, and instructions

Provide clear steps for integration

Build all UI pages with animations

🚫 WHAT THE AGENT MUST NOT DO

Do NOT preinstall Steam

Do NOT use copyrighted UI assets

Do NOT include placeholder lorem ipsum beyond short demo text

Do NOT skip files

Do NOT generate partial code unless asked

🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Generate a COMPLETE, WORKING starter build of NexarOS (Launcher, Store, Library, Settings, Updater) using the defined architecture and color palette.
All code must be testable immediately inside Replit.

END OF PROMPT

Build everything exactly as specified.
