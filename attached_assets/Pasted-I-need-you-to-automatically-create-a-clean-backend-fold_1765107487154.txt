I need you to automatically create a clean backend folder for deployment to Railway.
Follow these steps exactly:

=====================================================
🔴 1. Create a new folder at project root named /railway-backend

=====================================================
🔴 2. Identify all backend code
Backend code is currently inside:

/server

/shared

Any backend config files at root (e.g., package.json, tsconfig.json)

Frontend files (React) must NOT be included.

=====================================================
🔴 3. Move ALL backend files into /railway-backend
Inside /railway-backend, the structure must be FLAT — not nested.

The final /railway-backend folder MUST contain:

/railway-backend
package.json
server.js or index.js (whichever is the backend entry)
routes/
controllers/
utils/
data/
shared/
.env.example
.gitignore
tsconfig.json (if needed)

Rules:

If backend entry file is inside /server, move it directly into /railway-backend

DO NOT leave any backend files inside nested folders like /server/server.js

Flatten everything so Railway can detect Node.js

=====================================================
🔴 4. Generate a correct package.json in /railway-backend
If one exists already, rewrite it so it looks like this (modify entry file name accordingly):

{
"name": "nexaros-backend",
"version": "1.0.0",
"main": "server.js",
"scripts": {
"start": "node server.js"
},
"dependencies": {
"express": "^4.18.2",
"bcrypt": "^5.1.0",
"jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.0",
"cors": "^2.8.5",
"stripe": "^12.0.0",
"dotenv": "^16.0.0",
"resend": "^3.0.0"
}
}

If the entry file is named index.js, replace server.js with index.js.

=====================================================
🔴 5. Fix all import paths
If any backend files reference "../server/..." update them so they correctly reference the new flattened structure.

=====================================================
🔴 6. Do NOT modify any frontend files
Only backend files should be copied and reorganized.

=====================================================
🔴 7. When finished, confirm the final folder structure
Tell me:

The entry file name

The final file tree for /railway-backend

Whether everything is ready for ZIP export

=====================================================

This prepares the backend for Railway deployment.
