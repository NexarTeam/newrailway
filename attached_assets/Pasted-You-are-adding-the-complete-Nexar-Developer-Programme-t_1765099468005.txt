You are adding the complete Nexar Developer Programme to NexarOS.
This includes: developer roles, developer applications, developer dashboard, game submission tools, metadata handling, and admin approval system.

Implement everything exactly as defined below.

=====================================================
🔴 UPDATE USER MODEL

Modify the user model (users.json or DB later) to include developer fields:

Add to each user:

"role": "user", // default; can become "developer"
"developerProfile": {
"studioName": "",
"website": "",
"description": "",
"contactEmail": "",
"status": "none" // none, pending, approved, rejected
}

=====================================================
🔴 CREATE DEVELOPER APPLICATION SYSTEM

Developers must apply before becoming approved.

Create new backend routes:

POST /developer/apply
Body:
{
"studioName": "",
"contactEmail": "",
"website": "",
"description": ""
}

Logic:

User must be logged in

Validate required fields

If user already has status "pending" or "approved", prevent duplicate application

Set developerProfile fields and status = "pending"

Save changes to user

Return:
{ success: true, message: "Application submitted" }

GET /developer/status

Returns the logged-in user developerProfile + role

=====================================================
🔴 ADMIN REVIEW (TEMPORARY SYSTEM)

Create simple admin routes (manual for now):

POST /admin/developer/approve
POST /admin/developer/reject

Body: { userId }

Approve:

Set role = "developer"

Set developerProfile.status = "approved"

Reject:

Set developerProfile.status = "rejected"

=====================================================
🔴 DEVELOPER GAME METADATA SYSTEM

Developers need to submit game entries, but file upload is not yet required.

Create a backend store: backend/data/developerGames.json

Each entry:

{
"gameId": "generated",
"developerId": "userid",
"title": "",
"description": "",
"price": 0,
"genre": "",
"tags": [],
"status": "draft", // draft, pending, approved, rejected
"versions": [], // future file uploads
"createdAt": "",
"updatedAt": ""
}

POST /developer/game/create
Body:
{
"title": "",
"description": "",
"price": number,
"genre": "",
"tags": []
}

Logic:

Must be developer (role=developer & status=approved)

Generate unique gameId

Create new game record with status "draft"

Store game entry

Return new game data.

POST /developer/game/update
Body:
{
"gameId": "",
"title": "",
"description": "",
"price": number,
"genre": "",
"tags": []
}

Logic:

Only the game's creator can edit

Update metadata

Save changes

POST /developer/game/submitForReview
Body: { "gameId": "" }

Logic:

Set game.status = "pending"

Notify admin (placeholder)

GET /developer/games

Return all games created by the logged-in developer

=====================================================
🔴 ADMIN GAME APPROVAL SYSTEM

Add routes:

POST /admin/game/approve
POST /admin/game/reject

Body:
{ "gameId": "" }

Approve:

Set game.status = "approved"

Reject:

Set game.status = "rejected"

=====================================================
🔴 INTEGRATE DEVELOPER GAMES INTO STORE

Modify the main Nexar store logic:

Only show games where status = "approved"

When a game is approved, move the entry into store metadata (or mark approved)

=====================================================
🔴 FRONTEND UI IMPLEMENTATION

Add new navigation section:

Sidebar:

"Developer Portal" (visible only if dev is approved or pending)

"Apply as Developer" (if normal user)

🔵 PAGE 1: Developer Application Page
Path: /developer/apply

=====================================================
🔴 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

Only approved developers may access developer dashboard

Only developers can create/edit games

Only admins can approve developers & games

All routes must require JWT authentication

=====================================================
🔴 FINAL INTEGRATION CHECK

Ensure:

Developer application works correctly

Developer status persists in user model

Developer dashboard is visible only after approval

New games can be created, edited, and submitted for review

Admin approval updates store visibility

Frontend pages use NexarOS UI theme and components

JSON or DB storage is correctly updated

=====================================================
Generate ALL backend routes, updated user model, new frontend pages, navigation updates, and example entries.
