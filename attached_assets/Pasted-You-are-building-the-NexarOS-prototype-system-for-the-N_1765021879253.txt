You are building the NexarOS prototype system for the Nexar handheld console.
Replit cannot run Electron, so you must create a web-based version of NexarOS that mirrors exactly how the Electron desktop version will later behave.

ALL CODE MUST BE ELECTRON-COMPATIBLE, but must run normally in the Replit environment as a web app.

🎯 GOAL

Create a full working prototype of NexarOS consisting of:

React Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

Node.js Backend (Express)

REST API for Nexar Games Store

Web version of Library, Store, Home, Settings

Mock Steam Integration (steam library JSON uploaded manually by user)

Mock Installer System (simulated downloads + installs)

OTA Update Checker (checks JSON manifest)

Full Nexar dark/red UI theme

This prototype must be designed so that I can later export the project and wrap it with Electron outside of Replit without changing the code structure.

🖥 UI REQUIREMENTS

Build all the pages below using the NexarOS signature theme:

🎨 Nexar Color Palette

Primary Background: #000000 / #111111

Panels/Sections: #1A1A1A

Neon Red Accent: #d00024

Text Light: #EAEAEA

Text Dim: #A3A3A3

Pages to Build

✔ Home Screen (carousel, continue playing, quick shortcuts)
✔ Game Library (local JSON library, add/remove games)
✔ Nexar Games Store (REST API-driven)
✔ Game Details Page
✔ Settings (Theme, Network placeholder, System Info)
✔ Steam Library Import (upload JSON → display games)
✔ Downloads & Installations Page (simulated)

Each page must:

be fully styled

use animations

be controller/keyboard-friendly

feel premium (Xbox/PlayStation style UI)

🗂 FOLDER STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)
/nexaros
  /frontend
    /src
      /components
      /pages
      /hooks
      /assets
      main.jsx
      App.jsx
    package.json
    tailwind.config.js
    vite.config.js

  /backend
    /routes
      games.js
    /data
      games.json
    server.js
    package.json

  /shared
    config.json
    sample_steam_library.json


Keep this EXACT structure so it can be migrated into Electron later.

🔧 BACKEND REQUIREMENTS

Create an Express server with routes:

GET /games → list store games

GET /games/:id → game details

GET /games/:id/download → simulate download

GET /updates/latest → OTA manifest

Use JSON files for storage.

🎮 LIBRARY SYSTEM

Since Replit cannot access the real filesystem:

Implement a JSON-based virtual library

Supports: add game, delete game, mark installed, track progress

Later, this layer can be replaced with filesystem calls in Electron

🔧 STEAM INTEGRATION (WEB VERSION)

Replit cannot access Windows directories, so:

Allow users to upload their Steam libraryfolders.json file

Parse & display Steam games in the library

Tag them as “Steam Game”

🧠 WHAT THE AGENT MUST OUTPUT

When writing code:

Provide file-by-file content

Include complete working code, not partials

Ensure frontend + backend run in Replit

Provide commands:

npm install

npm run dev (frontend)

npm start (backend)

Provide integration steps between frontend & backend

Use the Nexar theme across all components

⛔ WHAT NOT TO DO

Do NOT try to run or configure Electron inside Replit

Do NOT use absolute disk paths (C:/…)

Do NOT insert pseudocode

Do NOT leave blank components

Do NOT simplify the UI beyond spec

▶️ PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Deliver a complete, production-grade NexarOS web prototype that mirrors the final Electron app — all code fully functional inside Replit.
