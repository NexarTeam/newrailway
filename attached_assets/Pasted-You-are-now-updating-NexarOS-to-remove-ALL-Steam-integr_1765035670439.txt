You are now updating NexarOS to remove ALL Steam integration and convert the system into a fully standalone Nexar-only gaming platform.

Perform the following changes across the entire codebase (frontend + backend):

=====================================================
            🚫 REMOVE ALL STEAM INTEGRATION
=====================================================

Remove completely:
- Steam library scanning
- Steam folder detection
- VDF (Steam config) parsing
- Steam install path lookup logic
- Steam API presence or usage
- Steam achievements
- Steam friends or session handling
- Steam-related metadata structures
- Steam UI tiles, filters, or import buttons
- Any Steam-specific routes or services in the backend

Files to modify:
- All backend routes that reference Steam
- Any helpers or utils related to Steam
- Library service functions that import from Steam
- Frontend components for Steam sections
- Settings or Library pages referencing Steam
- UI elements like “Import Steam Library,” “Open Steam,” or Steam icons

If any Steam-related code is tightly coupled or blocking, safely refactor or delete the related blocks and restructure the system to function WITHOUT Steam.

=====================================================
            🟦 REPLACE WITH NEXAR-ONLY SYSTEMS
=====================================================

Replace removed Steam features with a clean Nexar-only structure:

1. Nexar Game Manifest Format
   Instead of reading Steam data, create a manifest format:
   {
     "id": "string",
     "title": "string",
     "executable": "string",
     "installDir": "string",
     "coverArt": "string",
     "description": "string",
     "tags": ["Action", "Indie", ...]
   }

2. Nexar Library Management
   Rewrite the library backend so it reads/writes ONLY Nexar game manifests
   stored in something like /backend/data/library.json.

3. Nexar Installer Simulation
   Keep the current "install game" simulation but make it use the new Nexar
   manifest format instead of Steam app IDs.

4. Nexar Game Launcher Hook
   Create a placeholder launcher function:
   launchGame(gameId) → prepares for the future Electron bridge.
   In Replit, simulate the launch action.

5. Nexar Store Integration
   Update the Store page to reference Nexar’s game metadata only.
   No Steam categories, tags, or store links.

6. Nexar Achievements
   Ensure the system uses ONLY Nexar’s own achievement model.

7. Nexar Friends & Invites
   Confirm the social system is entirely independent from Steam.

=====================================================
            🧹 CLEANUP & FIXES
=====================================================

After removal:
- Ensure no unused imports remain.
- Remove any dead code or logs referencing Steam.
- Fix all broken references or undefined variables.
- Verify that the Library and Store pages load correctly.
- Confirm that adding/removing/listing games works normally.
- Ensure Settings no longer include Steam options.
- Update navigation so Steam is not referenced anywhere.

=====================================================
            🎨 UI / UX IMPROVEMENTS
=====================================================

Update UI so NexarOS feels like its own premium ecosystem:

- Replace any Steam icons with Nexar branding.
- Update empty-library state:
  “Your Nexar Library is empty. Install games from the Nexar Store.”
- Update Settings wording for Nexar-only platform.
- Enhance Library cards to use your red/dark theme.

=====================================================
                🧪 FINAL VALIDATION
=====================================================

Before finishing, run a full internal audit:

1. Can a user:
   - Login
   - Install a Nexar game
   - See it in the library
   - Launch it (simulated)
   - Manage profile/settings
   - Use friends/messages
   - Use achievements & cloud features

2. Confirm that NO Steam code, UI, imports, comments, or artifacts remain anywhere.

Return all modified files with complete working code.

=====================================================
Begin the full refactor now.
